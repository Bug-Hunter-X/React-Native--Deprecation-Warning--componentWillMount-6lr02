# React Native Deprecation Warning: componentWillMount

This repository demonstrates a common React Native bug related to the use of the deprecated `componentWillMount` lifecycle method and provides a solution using the modern `useEffect` hook.

The `bug.js` file contains the problematic code, while `bugSolution.js` shows the corrected implementation using the `useEffect` hook.

## Problem

The original code utilizes `componentWillMount` to fetch data and update the component's state. This approach is deprecated and can result in unexpected behavior, particularly if data fetching is asynchronous.

## Solution

The solution replaces `componentWillMount` with the `useEffect` hook. This allows us to perform side effects (like data fetching) after the component renders, ensuring correct state updates and rendering of the fetched data.
